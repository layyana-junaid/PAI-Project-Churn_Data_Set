### -We will implement all the examples given below to properly understand the functionality of "Numpy Library": 
#### 1. Statistical Analysis
#### While pandas has built-in methods for basic statistics, you can also use NumPy to calculate various statistics such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
#### Example: Calculating Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, and Variance

#### 2. Handling Missing Values
#### You can utilize NumPy to replace missing values with mean/median values or other strategies.
#### Example: Filling Missing Values with Mean

#### 3. Creating NumPy Arrays for Machine Learning Models
#### When working with machine learning algorithms, it's often necessary to convert your pandas data into NumPy arrays for use in libraries like scikit-learn.
#### Example: Converting Features and Labels into NumPy Arrays

#### 4. Mathematical Operations
#### NumPy provides fast and efficient mathematical operations on arrays. You can use these for feature engineering or transforming data before using it in machine learning algorithms.
#### Example: Normalize Data

#### 5. Correlation Matrix
#### You can use NumPy to calculate the correlation matrix between different features to find relationships between them, such as which features are strongly correlated with customer churn.
#### Example: Calculate Correlation

#### 6. Random Sampling
#### For testing or validation, you might need to sample random subsets of your data. NumPy's random module is perfect for this.
#### Example: Randomly Sample 1000 Customers

#### 7. Boolean Indexing with NumPy
#### You can use NumPy for efficient filtering and conditional operations. For example, if you want to isolate customers with high balances who churned, you can easily do this using boolean indexing with NumPy.
#### Example: Filtering Customers with High Balance Who Churned

#### 8. Vectorized Operations for Speed
#### NumPyâ€™s vectorized operations are much faster than loops for large datasets. You can replace loops with NumPy operations for performance improvements.
#### Example: Conditional Transformation Using Vectorized Operation
