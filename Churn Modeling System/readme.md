## What is Churn Modeling System?
### Churn modeling is a data analysis technique used to predict customer attrition or "churn," which refers to the loss of clients or customers over time.
## 1. Definition of Churn
#### Customer Churn: This occurs when a customer stops doing business with a company, such as unsubscribing from a service, not renewing a contract, or switching to a competitor. It can be quantified as a churn rate, often calculated as the number of customers lost divided by the total number of customers at the beginning of a period.
## 2. Purpose of Churn Modeling
#### Understanding Behavior: By analyzing why customers churn, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.
#### Retention Strategies: The goal is to identify at-risk customers and implement strategies to retain them, such as targeted marketing, improved customer service, or personalized offers.
#### Profitability: Reducing churn can significantly impact a company's profitability, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
